# NIHCHESTXRAYCLASSIFICATION
AI-Driven Multi-Label Chest X-Ray Classification Detection Using Deep Learning
# ü´Å Chest X-ray Multi-Disease Classification

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based multi-label classification system to automatically detect multiple thoracic diseases from chest X-ray images. Using the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, the model predicts the presence of conditions such as "Pneumonia", "Pneumothorax", "Cardiomegaly", "Pleural_thickening", "Fibrosis", "No Finding". It includes interpretable visualizations like Grad-CAM and evaluates performance using robust metrics.
